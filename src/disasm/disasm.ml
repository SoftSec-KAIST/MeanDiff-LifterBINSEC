   Given a set of address intervals to disassemble linearly, it also keeps track

   The benefit is that we are able to find and disassemble overlapping

   Another possible strategy would be:
   - linearly disassemble intervals, keeping track of the jump targets.
   - in the end, gather all jump targets recognized. For those whose address has
   not been disassembled, start a recursive disassembly.
